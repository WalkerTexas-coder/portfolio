4:T415,Hedfirst was migraine-only, limiting patient LTV to $499/year with no expansion revenue. Strategic thinking: Hypothesis was that migraine patients would value comprehensive health monitoring, especially if lab results revealed underlying conditions (vitamin deficiencies, hormone imbalances) contributing to migraines. Value clarification: This wasn't just feature expansion—it positioned Hedfirst as comprehensive health partner vs. single-condition treatment, increasing LTV and patient engagement. Design & prototyping: Analyzed 7-endpoint Choose Health API plus webhook system, designed patient-facing lab ordering flow, created provider dashboard for results review. Holistic implementation: Wrote 13 implementation tickets across frontend, backend, admin interfaces, and HIPAA-compliant data storage with 7-year retention. Impact: 40% of beta patients ordered lab tests within first month. Lab insights revealed vitamin deficiencies in 60% of patients, improving clinical outcomes while creating new revenue stream at $99-$145 per panel.0:{"P":null,"b":"WsEEwL3iWYbNypr16CTA4","p":"","c":["","projects",""],"i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["projects",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/6506593b3dbaab18.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}]],["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":["$","body",null,{"className":"antialiased","children":["$","$L2",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L3",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":[[["$","title",null,{"children":"404: This page could not be found."}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"fontFamily":"system-ui,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,\"Apple Color Emoji\",\"Segoe UI Emoji\"","height":"100vh","textAlign":"center","display":"flex","flexDirection":"column","alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center"},"children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","style",null,{"dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"body{color:#000;background:#fff;margin:0}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.3)}@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark){body{color:#fff;background:#000}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.3)}}"}}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"next-error-h1","style":{"display":"inline-block","margin":"0 20px 0 0","padding":"0 23px 0 0","fontSize":24,"fontWeight":500,"verticalAlign":"top","lineHeight":"49px"},"children":404}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"display":"inline-block"},"children":["$","h2",null,{"style":{"fontSize":14,"fontWeight":400,"lineHeight":"49px","margin":0},"children":"This page could not be found."}]}]]}]}]],[]],"forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]}]}]]}],{"children":["projects",["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L3",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":["__PAGE__",["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"min-h-screen","children":[["$","section",null,{"className":"py-20 px-6 md:px-12","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container mx-auto max-w-4xl text-center","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold mb-8","children":"Major Projects"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-xl md:text-2xl leading-relaxed mb-12","children":"Product management in healthcare is 50% strategy, 50% operational obsession.

Made critical tradeoff: chose Choose Health over competitors for lab integration due to better API documentation, even though it was more expensive—this decision saved 2+ weeks of integration time.
