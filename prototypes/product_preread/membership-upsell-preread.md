# AI Care Membership Upsell Card Redesign
## Product Pre-Read Document

**Date:** November 21, 2025  
**Author:** Austin Walker, Product Manager  
**Stakeholder:** Dr. Jane Doe  
**Status:** Discovery / Design Exploration

---

## Executive Summary

The current AI Care Membership upsell card appears during checkout for non-members and logged-out users. Feedback indicates the current design does not effectively communicate the membership's value proposition—specifically the $200 annual savings and the significant time/cost advantages over traditional healthcare pathways.

This document outlines the business case, proposed design directions, and a framework for evaluating and implementing changes.

---

## Problem Statement

**Current State:** The existing upsell card presents membership benefits and pricing but fails to prominently communicate:
- The $200/year savings compared to non-member pricing
- The $300-500 cost savings compared to traditional healthcare (GP visits, referrals, wait times)
- The 2-3 month time savings by avoiding traditional care pathways

**Impact:** Potential members may not understand the full value proposition, leading to lower conversion rates at a critical decision point in the purchase flow.

---

## Business Objectives

1. **Increase membership conversion rate** at checkout for non-members
2. **Clearly communicate value proposition** through savings-focused messaging
3. **Differentiate HealthPlatform** from traditional healthcare pathways
4. **Maintain brand consistency** while improving visual hierarchy

---

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Current Baseline | Target |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| Upsell card click-through rate | TBD | +15-25% |
| Membership add-to-cart rate | TBD | +10-20% |
| Membership conversion at checkout | TBD | +5-10% |

*Note: Baseline metrics to be confirmed with analytics team prior to implementation.*

## Design Exploration Summary

Three enhanced design directions have been developed, each emphasizing savings and efficiency messaging differently:

### Option A: Major Savings Focus (Green/Comparison)
**Approach:** Side-by-side comparison layout showing Traditional Healthcare vs AI Care Member

**Key Elements:**
- Prominent savings banner: "SAVE $200+ ANNUALLY + SKIP MONTHS OF WAITING"
- Direct comparison box showing cost and time differences
- Total savings callout: "$300-500+ per year"

**Best For:** Users who respond to logical, comparative decision-making

---

### Option B: Time & Money Efficiency (Blue/Benefit Icons)
**Approach:** Benefit-focused layout with clear iconography and highlighted savings

**Key Elements:**
- Top badge: "SKIP THE WAIT • SAVE $200+ YEARLY"
- Icon-driven benefit list (skip wait times, avoid costs, AI insights)
- Large $200 savings highlight box

**Best For:** Users who scan quickly and respond to visual hierarchy

---

### Option C: Bold Savings Statement (Orange/Pathway)
**Approach:** High-impact header with before/after pathway visualization

**Key Elements:**
- Mega header: "SAVE $200+/YEAR"
- Traditional Path vs AI Care Path comparison
- Clear time contrast: "2-3 months" vs "Days"

**Best For:** Users who respond to urgency and bold value statements

## Product Framework: Evaluating Design Direction

### 1. Value Clarity
*Does the design immediately communicate what the user gains?*

| Criterion | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------|
| $200 savings visible without scrolling | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Time savings clearly stated | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Traditional care comparison | ✅ | ⚠️ Partial | ✅ |

### 2. Brand Alignment
*Does the design fit HealthPlatform's visual identity?*

Consider: Color palette, typography, tone of voice, existing component patterns

### 3. Conversion Psychology
*What behavioral triggers does each design leverage?*

- **Option A:** Loss aversion (showing what they'd pay otherwise), social proof through comparison
- **Option B:** Cognitive ease (scannable benefits), anchoring on savings number
- **Option C:** Urgency, contrast effect (old way vs new way)

### 4. Implementation Complexity
*What level of effort is required?*

| Factor | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| Component changes | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| Copy changes | High | Medium | High |
| A/B test complexity | Low | Low | Low |

### 5. Risk Assessment
*What could go wrong?*

- **Overclaiming:** Ensure $300-500 savings claim is defensible and compliant
- **Brand dilution:** Bold designs (especially Option C) may feel inconsistent
- **Information overload:** Too much comparison data could slow decision-making

## Discussion Questions for Team Review

1. **Messaging Validation:** Do we have data supporting the $300-500 traditional care cost comparison? What disclaimers might be needed?

2. **Brand Fit:** Which design direction best aligns with HealthPlatform's brand guidelines and existing checkout experience?

3. **Testing Strategy:** Should we A/B test multiple options, or select one direction based on qualitative feedback?

4. **Placement:** Is the current upsell card placement optimal, or should we explore alternative positions in the checkout flow?

5. **Segmentation:** Should messaging vary based on user context (e.g., disease state, cart value, returning vs new user)?

---

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Align on design direction** based on team discussion
2. **Validate savings claims** with clinical/compliance team
3. **Finalize copy** with approved messaging
4. **Create high-fidelity mockups** in Figma for selected direction
5. **Define A/B test plan** with analytics team
6. **Create implementation tickets** for development
